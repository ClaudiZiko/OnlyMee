# em this is all possible because i'm in love.

# I hope you guys don't laugh because I did something that stupid.


# I made it myself without any help from friends, just asking AI for something that errored.

# I don't expect much, I just don't know what to do. So I just play around while learning to understand this html code that I made with the help of AI


# 13.28 I feel like I'm stupid and shouldn't have approached that girl.


# I don't know if he likes me or is just playing with me, but this isn't the first time for me.


 # there was this girl who used to chase me all the way to my house and tell me she loved me. But I just thought it was puppy love since we were just middle school kids who hadn’t even hit puberty yet.

# So I just ignored her and turned her down. She was a pretty girl, but unfortunately, I had nothing to take responsibility for. That’s what I thought at the time.

# There were many more, but that’s all I can share.

# Now I know what love at first sight is. I can't find the words to explain it; I’m just amazed by the sight of her smiling every moment. She always laughs so happily, and I love seeing it, as if her smile and laughter bring warmth and happiness to everyone around her. I hope I can be that happy too.

# "Well, that's it for now. I’m on March 2nd, 2025." :)
